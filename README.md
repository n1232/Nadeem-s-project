# EATING RIGHT 

## <b>OVERVIEW</b>

Eating Right is a website which has the purpose of promoting and encouraging people to eat healthier. In order to try and achieve this, I have included various features in the website such as a section which educates the user on a balanced diet, a video on how to diet on a budget in addition to a variety of healthy recipes which users can choose from. The target audience of Eating Right is the health conscious in addition to those who are trying or wanting to be.

## <b>TESTING</b>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I am able to confirm that the website works on different browsers: Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

I able to confirm that the website's images are diplayed nicely, the video works and how links for the website work as intended.

I am also able to confirm that the website is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

Upon testing, all sections consisting of text like logo, nav bar etc. are readable

I have tested all funtions and features of the website which work and meet purpose.

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

One of the bugs I have encountered along the way include one to to do with the social media icons for the footer, where the actual icons would not display. I managed to solve this after realising that I had to sign up for Font Awesome first.

Another bug I encountered was to do with the Budget dieting tips video, where I tried to adjust the video size. Initially, I made a class which I assigned to the video in Html and tried styling in CSS but this didn't lead to the intended outcome. I then tried styling the video tag directly in HTML which worked.

Also, when using the navbar on one occasion I realised that when on an individual recipe page, the navbar was showing that I was on the references page when it was meant to show that I was on the healthy recipes page. I realised sooner or later that it was to do with the active class which was the case. Once the active class was assigned to the corrrect hyperlink, this bug was also fixed.
